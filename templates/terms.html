    <p>Schoology Recap is a really basic project built by students for students. As such, we treat your data with the utmost care and respect.</p>
    <p>By generating your recap, you agree that we will use your data to:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Process assignment data to generate your recap</li>
            <li>Email you when your recap is ready and for other Tech Club news</li>
            <li>To create anonymous aggregate statistics about student behavior</li>
            <li>To record anonymous telemetry data to improve our product</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The Pinewood Tech club will <u>not</u>:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Store any of your Schoology data other than the generated statistics that are displayed in your recap</li>
